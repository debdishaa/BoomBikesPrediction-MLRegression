# BoomBikesPrediction-MLRegression

Project Overview
This project is part of my postgraduate program in Data Science at IIIT Bangalore. The objective of this assignment is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The prediction model will help BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service provider, understand the factors influencing bike demand and strategize accordingly to increase their revenue post-COVID-19 pandemic.

Problem Statement
BoomBikes has experienced a significant revenue dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To prepare for an expected increase in demand once the lockdowns are lifted, the company wants to understand the key factors that affect bike demand. By modeling the demand with available independent variables, BoomBikes aims to adjust their business strategy to better meet customer needs and stand out from competitors.

Business Goals
Identify significant variables in predicting bike demand.
Understand how these variables influence demand.
Provide insights for BoomBikes to develop strategies to meet future demand levels.
